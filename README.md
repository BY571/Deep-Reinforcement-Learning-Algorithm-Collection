# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning


![Logo](/imgs/web-3706562_640.jpg)

In this repository I document my path of learning about Reinforcement Learning.
The goal is to understand, implement and document fundamental algorithms of Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Starting with Q-Learning (Table) going to Deep Q-Learning with several extensions (Experience Replay, Action Selection...) and in the end approching state of the art Deep Reinforcement Algorithms like A3C, A2C, PPO, TRPO, DDPG, D4PG.
Most of the algorithms were tested in the Open Ai python library gym. 

Below a list of Jupyter Notebooks with implementations
