# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning


![Logo](/imgs/web-3706562_640.jpg)

In this repository I document my path of learning about Reinforcement Learning.
The goal is to understand, implement and document fundamental algorithms of Deep Reinforcement Learning.
Starting with Q-Learning (Table) going to Deep Q-Learning with several extensions (Experience Replay, Action Selection...) and in the end approching state of the art Deep Reinforcement Algorithms like A3C, A2C, PPO, TRPO, DDPG, D4PG and Multi-Agent DRL.
The algorithms are implemented in Python with the Deep Learning library Pytorch and tested in the Open Ai gym.

Below a list of Jupyter Notebooks with implementations
