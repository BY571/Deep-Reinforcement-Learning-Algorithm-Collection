### Genetic Algorithms

#### Baseline implementation [GA_cartpole](https://github.com/BY571/Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/Black-Box%20Optimization/genetic_algorithm_base.py)
- run 'python genetic_algorithm_base.py' with the flags: '--noise', '--ps', '--pc' as:
    - '--noise'(std) that is added as the mutation of the neural network weights, default = 0.05
    - '--ps' as the population size, default = 50
    - '--pc' as the parents count or amount of top performer that build the new population, default = 10
    
Example performance with noise_std = 0.05, ps=30, pc=10
